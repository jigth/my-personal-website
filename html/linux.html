        <h3>Linux and Bash Scripting</h3>
        <p class="skills-description">Because the great frustration that came by using Windows on my PC, for serious work it was really, reaaally slow. So I decided to learn more about Linux and make it my main Operative System. I already knew some basic commands but I went more in depth and learned about some <strong>GNU Core Utilities</strong>, development software and command line concepts such as Shell Expansion, Shell Pipelines and Bash Scripting. WIth that learned I feel that Unix systems in general (and Linux in particular) are really versatile and I love to use them almost everyday!</p>

        <p class="skills-description">
          <em>I still use Windows mostly for gaming, as a playstation, but mostly avoid it for anything else if it's not the best available option to solve a given problem.</em>
