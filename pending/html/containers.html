    <h1>Containers</h1>

    <h2>Docker</h2>
    <p>I've been practicing Docker by deploying different frontend and backend services in local environments or other servers</p>

    <h2>Docker Compose</h2>
    <p>When it's more convenient, for example, working with multiple containers I preffer to use <strong>Docker Compose</strong> because it's easier than other container orchestators and it does the job well</p>
